# Predict-Customer-Churn
Project 1 of Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity. [Link](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821)


## Project Description
identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The implementation follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). 

To use this package, navigate to **churn_tests.py** and run python churn_tests.py. The test cases read .csv file from data, run all implemented functions and store results to images folder. trained models are saved to models folder.

Training data was obtained pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/code)

## Results overview

Without loss of generality, the following figures shows how churn is related to income category. Complete figures of exploratory results can be found under images/eda
